          Hello, my name is Daniel. I am a passionate and self-taught React
          developer, although I don't have formal experience in the field,
          has invested a significant amount of time honing my skills through
          exercises, courses, and personal projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have developed various projects using React and other technologies
          such as Redux, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, SCSS, Bootstrap, MUI, Styled
          Components, i18next, among others. This has allowed me to delve deeply
          into its ecosystem, working with Hooks, component lifecycle, and
          component optimization. I have also used popular libraries like
          SweetAlert for custom alerts, Toastify for notifications, and tools
          like react-spinners and react-datepicker, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have focused on thoroughly understanding API management, optimizing
          interactions between the frontend and backend to ensure that
          applications are efficient and meet user needs. Additionally, all my
          developments are fully responsive, ensuring an excellent user
          experience on any device.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this portfolio, you will find some of my most notable projects, all
          of which are available for deployment and review. You can also view my
          code on my GitHub profile, including this very portfolio, built with
          Next.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am especially motivated by continuous learning and the opportunity
          to contribute my knowledge to a team, always striving to enhance user
          experience and optimize application performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to be part of an environment where I can grow
          professionally, share ideas, collaborate on challenging projects, and
          contribute to the team's success with everything I have learned so
          far.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am confident that my ability to learn quickly, my enthusiasm, as
          well as my tenacity and strong commitment to achieving my goals, will
          allow me to adapt rapidly and add value from day one.
